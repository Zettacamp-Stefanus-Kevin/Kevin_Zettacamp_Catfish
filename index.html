            <p>October 18, 2021</p>
            <p style="color: green;"> Considered the tactical leader of the Eternals, possesses enhanced strength,
                flight, and can project powerful cosmic beams from his eyes. In the comics he also shows up in a ton of
                myths, including as the dove on Noah's ark, and the Icarus of Greek myth was actually his son.</p>

            <p>October 18, 2021</p>
            <p style="color: green;"> Leads the Eternals in the film and has healing powers and can communicate with the
                Celestials. In the comics Ajak has the usual superpowers and is also a man who was known to the ancient
                Greeks as the Trojan war hero Ajax the greater. He later appeared in ancient Mesoamerica as the god
                Quetzalcoatl, something we think will still be the case given that in the movie Ajak is played by one of
                Mexico's most famous actresses.</p>

            <p style="color: green;"> Able to manipulate matter at the atomic level, in the comics she can also fly,
                teleport and do other super things. And fun fact: In the Marvel Comics universe, she was known to the
                ancient Greeks as Circe, the witch who became Odysseus' lover for a time in Homer's "The Odyssey.</p>

            <p style="color: green;"> A fierce warrior, can form weaponry out of thin air (and yes she also has the
                usual other super powers). But don't let the name trick you: In the Marvel Comics universe, the Greek
                gods actually exist, so Thena is NOT the same as Athena. She did however do a lot of the things Athena
                was credited with.</p>

                expressly not the same, as the Greek god Hephaestus.</p>
